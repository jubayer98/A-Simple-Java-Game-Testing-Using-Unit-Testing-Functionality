# Java Bowling Game: Unit Testing Guide

## Overview

In this project, we develop a simple Java-based bowling game and utilize unit testing to ensure the code functions correctly, identify bugs, and verify the behavior of game mechanics. The use of unit testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring the game runs as expected under various scenarios.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing involves writing small test cases that individually test components or methods within the game code. Hereâ€™s how you might structure tests for the bowling game:

## Continuous Testing

- **Integration with Development Environment:** Integrate the unit tests into your IDE to run tests automatically during development.
- **Continuous Integration (CI) Tools:** Use CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions to automate testing when changes are pushed to the repository.

## Benefits of Unit Testing

- **Early Bug Detection:** Bugs are detected early in the development process, saving time and effort.
- **Code Quality:** Regular testing ensures that the codebase remains reliable and maintainable.
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as additional documentation for how the game should behave.

Unit testing, while initially adding some development overhead, pays dividends by reducing bugs and improving code quality.
